<h2>The top 4 movies of 2023</h2>
<hr />

<h3>1. Oppenheimer </h3>
    <p>This movie was well directed by Christopher Nolan. The multiple Oscars won indicate just
how great the movie was. Top tier cast including Cilian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon,
 Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt. </p>

<h3>2. John Wick: Chapter 4</h3>
    <p>Another action packed movie starring Keanu Reaves. This was the perfect conclusion to the franchise. The addition of Donnie Yen is the cherry on top. </p>

<h3>3. Guy Ritchie's The Covenant</h3>
    <p> This movie was a compelling drama. Well written with strong themes of commitment and trust. Jake Gyllenhaal did a great job as the lead actor. </p>

<h3>4. Past Lives</h3>
    <p>A story about missed chances and love. Past Lives is one of the best movies I have watched with a twist that I didn't expect at all. </p>
